<strong>If You Believe, You Will Receive Whatever You Ask For In Prayer. Matthew 21:22.</strong><br>

Few years ago I joined campus one on the top institutions in my country.Deep down
I had a real joy,it was a dream come true.It felt as though I was at the top of
The world.During my first at the university I was so focused with my education
That that year I was among the few students who appeared in the pass list in 
My class,I learned this when the results were released by the university’s examination board.
When the second year came I was so over confident.Afraid to miss the college fun I was
Eager to try new things.Among them was  doing drugs.Marijuana also made it to my list
Among few others.After all,I had seen  and heard many students who were in drugs
And were just doing fine with their studies,that kind of thinking gave me the green light 
To pursue that kind of life.During second year first semester is that in my mind
Everything my education was going right but in reality things were going south.I was 
Stuck by my first years good performance,thinking that I was smart enough to
excel yet again.Literally drugs deluded me.During the end of that semester’s year I was
Seeing darkness in examination room and that  is when  epiphanies of how I made
terrible decisions.After few weeks holiday I returned to school again.What was
Amusing me at that second semester is that I never changed my life style despite
The terrible experience I did face earlier.I was caught up in a drug trap that I had
No formula how to escape.Sad life began to hit since I knew I was destined to failure
If that toxic behaviour persists.Yet again I failed in exams the way I never Imagined
In my life I would.I was standing at the point of facing discontinuation at this point
In college.I was so depressed and hated my life.It was a real pain,I never thought
I was that foolish.I couldn’t see how my education will progress anymore.I hit the 
Rock bottom,my thoughts run dry not knowing how my situation could change for 
Better.Ultimately my last decision was to run to God.At this point I was seeking 
Comfort,I did tell myself I got it wrong and God won’t bother changing my 
Situation.I did knew choices has consequences so I had to live with my painful
Failures.At that point I quit attending lectures.I wanted to focus on Jesus.After
I tried using my own knowledge had what I got was failure.I did start attending
Church regularly.Yes,my circles also began to enlarge since I was meeting
College students who were living for God.My wounds started healing slowly since I was relating
With other kinds of friends who had a different mindset.As the time moved on,I made a decision
To start going to the university library when am not involved in church work.What made me go to
Library was fascinating.Since I had enrolled to pursue business and information technology
Course,I had heard a lecturer who was introducing us to C programming language in first say
That whoever would get the things he was teaching us right that knowledge would enable
The person to earn a decent living in the internet.I did a research and I couldn’t
Described my feelings using words to learn one didn’t need a college degree to excel
In computing world.Since my parents had gifted me with a laptop in my early days at
Campus,I downloaded free tutorials from the internet .The main objective was to be
A software engineer.I focused on this knowing that I had no any other choice.Initially
Things were very hard.I gave up many times along the way but some small voice
In told me to continue trying.After all I had no options so I had to do it whether
I liked it or not.Eventually,after long trials I began understanding technical concepts.This 
Motivated me a lot.How cannot it be when things started to got easier.There was so much
Hope,I had placed my name to the class of failure where I thought come back would never
Be possible.It was hard to believe.To cut the long story short is that as we speak I am
Among the online merchants which are doing well.Not only did I end up being a exceptional
Web developer I also operate as a data analyst helping struggling companies sit at the top
Of the game.Among the best decisions I have  ever made in my life was to have a personal
Relationship with Jesus Christ and also to make a decision to drop out of college.Today
I am 100 % convinced their nothing God cannot do.I did see him move mountains
In my life and their nothing I can offer to him except my own heart,He has it all.Dear
Reader if you’re at a position where nothing seems to work in your life,God is waiting
For you with open arms ready to give you a rest you have never found in this world.God
Has it all.Do not allow doubts in mind discourage you from seeking God’s intervention,in fact
Doubts are enemy’s tool which he uses to imprison God’s people from their true purpose
In this life.The good thing about God is that he will speak the language that your minds understands
To inform you about you genuine purpose in this world.The joy you will find waking up to advance
Your real purpose is out of this world.If it is the money or peace is what your seeking will find away
To find you wherever you might be.In Case you’re wondering where to begin a relationship with
God worry no more.Just use google and search “how to begin a relationship with God?”.Read few articles online and begin the process that you will learn.Then find a bible and read at least one chapter of the book of your choice consistently for two months.At first it will be hard to do this
But in due time you will experience the real power of the creator of the universe speaking to you.When it is all said and done that will be the best decision you’ll ever make in  your life.
Before I finish I will tell this knowledge is power or rather gold.God says his people perish
Because of lack of knowledge.If you decide to take a step of faith then I suggest also you
Consider investing your time studying tools of info technology.Not only will you be informed
But rather at the end you gain powerful valuable skills that can make your life become better.
In my part I have developed a project guide which can help anyone interested in learning
  Web Development from scratches to professional level.Such projects takes a lot of time
And efforts to develop hence the reason I made a choice to charge it small price.If you’re
